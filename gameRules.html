        <h1>RULES FOR<br>TIC-TAC-TOE</h1>
        <p>Tic-tac-toe is a two player paper-and-pencil game, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os.</p>
        <p>The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) on an
            empty square on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically,
            or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game
            is a draw.</p>
        <ol class="rules">
            <li>Choose who will go first (either X or O).</li>
            <li>The first player places their symbol on an empty square on the grid.</li>
            <li>The second player places their symbol on an empty square on the grid.</li>
            <li>The first player takes their turn again, and so on, until one of the players gets three of their symbols
                in a row or all of the squares on the grid are filled
            </li>
            <li>If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. If all the squares on the grid are
                filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all there is to it! Tic-tac-toe is a simple but fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all
            ages.</p>
